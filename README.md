# CMPUT174_Pong

## About
This is the mini-project 2 of CMPUT 174 Fall 2020, UAlberta. I uploaded it to redesign and recode the whole thing, because I didn't feel happy with how I wrote the program and the documentation. It's also a good way to practice coding in my free time.

*Made using Python and Pygame.*

## How to play
Pong is a simple arcade game, where 2 players would control 2 paddles and
prevent the ball from touching the left and right edge.
- The ball will first appear in the middle of the window (and then move)
- If the ball touches the left edge, the right player scores and vice versa.
- Whoever gets to 10 points first win. The game will then stop.
